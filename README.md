# DisableWinDefend by Zoic

This script is post Defender Update (KB2267602) that pretty much patched any windows defender disable scripts

In this script realtime protection is turned off before disabling any group polices or services so that everything works as it should
the script will open up the windows security app and navigate using the arrow keys to disable realtime protection for you

THIS SCRIPT IS MADE FOR WIN 10 ONLY (WIN 11 IS SHIT)
